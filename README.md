# TwitterPopularity

This code is to predict a series of popularity values of a post when it is published in different time. The code needs win7+python2.7.

It is too large to upload the data in 2DataRandom here. And please download it at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Kr5nuDaIKIibMxUoew7H5w.
After downloading the data, just excute 10LFMFeatureBasic\zLFMFeaturePerTweet.bat. And the results (SEN, SPE and G-Mean) will be saved in computePerTweetSum.txt.

CNNBaselinePrediction is the baseline of CNN. To run it, please see https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf.
